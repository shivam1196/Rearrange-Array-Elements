PROBLEM 9: Rearrange Array Elements

This problem asked us to rearrange a list of numbers and return a list of two numbers which were the highest and lowest
possible numbers formed after rearranging the numbers from the list.
The expected runtime complexity for this problem is O(nlogn)

Algorithm:
1. Sort the list using Merge Sort in descending order
2. Then the digits in even index were combined to form the highest number and digits in odd index were
    combined to form the second highest number index
3. Finally return array of highest and second highest number

Time Complexity :

Merge Sort : O(N log N)
Rearranging: O(N)
The overall complexity = O(N logN) + O(N) = O(N logN)

Space Complexity :
List of size N: O(N)
Highest Number String: O(N/2)
Second Highest String: O(N/2)

The overall complexity = O(N) +O(N/2)+ O(N/2) = O(N)
